# Yelp Dataset Analysis with Snowflake & AWS S3

This project demonstrates how to process and analyze the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/) using AWS S3, Snowflake, and Python for sentiment analysis. The data is transformed from JSON to tabular format, loaded into Snowflake, and queried for insights.

   - Unzip the `.tar` file using Python to avoid file corruption.
2. **Upload Files to AWS S3**
   - Bucket: `yelp-project01`
3. **Connect AWS S3 with Snowflake**
   - Set IAM roles, trust relationships, and policies.
4. **Create Snowflake Tables**
   - Run scripts to create raw and tabular data tables.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Use Python UDF in Snowflake using `TextBlob`.
6. **Run Analytical Queries**
   - Execute business-related insights queries from `analysis_queries.sql`.
